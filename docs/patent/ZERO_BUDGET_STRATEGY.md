# 🆓 Zero-Budget IP Protection Strategy

**For:** Inventors with limited resources prioritizing essential protections  
**Updated:** November 8, 2025  

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**You've already completed the most critical step:** Filing your provisional patent (USPTO 63/846,150).

Your invention—the **SpiralCode™ technology**—is now protected by a valid **priority date** (July 18, 2025). Nobody can patent the same methods unless you abandon your application or let it expire.

**Everything else can be done for free or deferred until you have budget.**

- **Status:** ✅ Active until July 18, 2026
- **Cost:** Already paid ($130 provisional filing fee)

## 📅 Timeline: What Costs Money and When

### Phase 1: Now - July 2026 (FREE)
**Focus:** Maintain protection without spending

| Action | Cost | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Use ™ symbols | $0 | ✅ Active |
| Add "Patent Pending" notices | $0 | ✅ Active |
| Document continuous use | $0 | Ongoing |
| Preliminary prior art search | $0 | Free USPTO tools |
| Common law trademark protection | $0 | ✅ Valid |

**Total cost:** $0  
**Protection level:** Strong (patent priority + brand claim)

---

### Phase 2: By July 2026 (REQUIRED COST)
**Focus:** Convert provisional to non-provisional patent

**The Critical Decision:**

| Option | Cost | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|------|
| **Pro Se (DIY)** | $2,000-$5,000 | Lowest cost, full control | Requires deep technical/legal knowledge, claims may be weaker |
| **Attorney-Assisted** | $10,000-$15,000 | Professional quality, stronger claims | High cost, less control over process |
| **Hybrid (Attorney for claims only)** | $4,000-$8,000 | Best cost/quality balance | Still requires DIY for specification |

**Minimum Required (Pro Se):**
- USPTO filing fees: $700-$800 (micro entity rates)
- Patent drawings: $500-$1,500
- Specification writing: Your time (80-120 hours)
- Claims drafting: Your time (critical - consider hiring attorney just for this)

**Micro Entity Qualification (Reduces Fees by 75%):**
- ✅ < 4 previous patent applications
- ✅ Annual income < $222,244
- ✅ Not assigned to large entity
- **Savings:** ~$2,000 in reduced filing fees

---

### Phase 3: Post-2026 (OPTIONAL)
**Focus:** Enhanced protection when budget allows

| Action | Cost | Urgency | Can Defer Until |
|--------|------|---------|-----------------|
| Registered Trademarks (®) | $700-$1,400 | Low | 2027+ or never |
| PCT International Filing | $4,000-$6,000 | Medium | Within 12 months of non-prov |
| National Phase Entries | $5K-$10K each | Low | 30 months from priority |

**Key Insight:** All of these are **optional enhancements**. Your core protection (patent + common law TM) remains valid without them.

## ⚖️ What Happens If You Don't Trademark Register?

**Short answer:** Nothing bad.

### What You Keep Without Registration:
- ✅ Right to use the name (SpiralCode™, SpiralBrain™)
- ✅ Common law protection in regions where you use it
- ✅ Ability to enforce against copycats in your geographic area
- ✅ First-use priority if someone tries to register it later

### What You Don't Get Without Registration:
- ❌ Nationwide presumption of ownership
- ❌ Ability to sue in federal court (easily)
- ❌ ® symbol (only ™ allowed)
- ❌ International registration options

### When You Should Register:
- 💰 When you have $700-$1,400 budget
- 🚀 Before major product launch
- 🌎 When expanding to new geographic markets
- ⚔️ If competitor tries to register similar mark

**But:** You can operate for years on common law rights alone. Many successful businesses do.

## 🚨 Priority Decision Matrix

Use this to decide where to spend limited resources:

| Scenario | Recommendation | Budget |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Zero budget until 2026** | Use common law ™, defer everything else | $0 |
| **$2K-$5K available by July 2026** | Pro se patent filing, skip trademarks | $2K-$5K |
| **$5K-$10K available** | Hybrid: attorney for claims + DIY spec, skip TM | $5K-$10K |
| **$10K-$15K available** | Full attorney patent filing, defer TM | $10K-$15K |
| **$15K+ available** | Attorney patent + PCT, consider TM | $15K+ |

**Never sacrifice patent filing to pay for trademark registration.** The patent protects your invention; the trademark only protects the name.

## 📝 If Competitor Copies Your Brand Name

Even without registered trademark, you have options:

### Step 1: Cease and Desist Letter (Free)
```
I am the common law trademark holder of "SpiralCode™" (first use July 2025).
Evidence: [GitHub repo dated July 2025, patent filing dated July 18 2025]
Your use of [similar name] infringes my prior rights.
Demand: Cease use within 30 days or face legal action.
```

### Step 2: DMCA Takedown (Free)
If they're on GitHub, AWS, etc.:
- File DMCA notice citing trademark infringement
- Platforms often comply even for common law marks
- Costs nothing

### Step 3: Legal Action (Costly but Possible)
- Common law rights ARE enforceable in court
- You have evidence: dated GitHub commits, patent filing
- Registered TM makes it easier, but not required
