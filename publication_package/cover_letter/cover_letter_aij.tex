Dear Editor,

We submit our manuscript entitled ``SpiralBrain v3.0: A Four-Lobe Cognitive Architecture for Autonomous Reasoning'' for consideration in Artificial Intelligence Journal.

This work introduces SpiralBrain v3.0, a novel cognitive architecture that integrates symbolic reasoning with neural processing through four specialized lobes: Perception, Memory, Reasoning, and Action. The architecture demonstrates autonomous mode selection, endogenous adaptation, and structured reasoning capabilities that advance the state-of-the-art in cognitive AI systems.

\textbf{Key Contributions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A complete cognitive architecture with four interdependent lobes
\item Autonomous reasoning mode selection based on task complexity
\item Endogenous internal adaptation mechanisms
\item Validation across multiple cognitive domains
\item Integration of symbolic and neural processing paradigms
\end{itemize}

The manuscript presents empirical results from comprehensive benchmarks, including MMLU performance analysis, emotional regulation experiments, and cross-domain validation. All code, data, and replication materials are available in the public repository.

We believe this work aligns with AIJ's mission to publish significant advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of cognitive architectures and autonomous systems.

Thank you for considering our submission.
