## 🧫 Dynamic Range Adaptation System

### Core Innovation: Stretch & Snap Back

The brain now implements **self-regulating flexibility** that automatically adjusts learning constraints:

#### Range Elasticity Parameters
```yaml
elasticity:
  max_stretch: 2.0      # Maximum expansion factor
  stretch_rate: 0.1     # How fast ranges expand during growth
  snap_rate: 0.05       # How fast ranges contract during consolidation
```

#### Adaptive Behavior Examples

**Growth Phase Detection:**
- Low confidence (< 0.4) in recent experiences
- High unknown ratio (> 50%) in semantic processing
- Stagnant reward trends (< 0.05 improvement)

**Range Expansion:**
- `confidence_min`: 0.75 → 0.30 (allows exploration of uncertain domains)
- `valence_range`: [-0.5, 0.7] → [-1.0, 1.4] (broader emotional processing)

**Consolidation Phase:**
- High reward trends (> 0.6) in recent experiences
- Strong competence signals across domains
- Gradual constraint tightening to maintain safety
