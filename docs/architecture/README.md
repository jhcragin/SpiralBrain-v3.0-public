## 📚 Key Concepts

### Four-Lobe Architecture
SpiralBrain's cognitive capabilities emerge from the interaction of four specialized lobes:

1. **Sensus (🔵 Perception)** - Processes sensory input with quantum-inspired mechanisms
2. **Nexus (💙 Emotion)** - Handles emotional intelligence and social cognition
3. **Codex (🟢 Analysis)** - Performs logical reasoning and knowledge processing
4. **Cortex (🟣 Executive)** - Coordinates integration and executive control

### Integration Principles
- **Phase Locking** - Lobes synchronize for coherent processing
- **Dynamic Routing** - Information flows based on task demands
- **Emergent Properties** - Capabilities exceed individual lobe functions
- **Adaptive Weighting** - Integration adjusts to context

### Design Philosophy
- **Modularity** - Clear lobe boundaries with defined interfaces
- **Flexibility** - Adaptive processing based on requirements
- **Robustness** - Graceful degradation when lobes are unavailable
- **Transparency** - Explainable decision-making processes
