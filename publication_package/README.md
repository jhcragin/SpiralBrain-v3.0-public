# SpiralBrain v3.0 Submission to Artificial Intelligence Journal

This folder contains the journal-specific submission package for *Artificial Intelligence Journal* (AIJ), derived from the canonical root files.

## Purpose

This is a **projection** of the canonical SpiralBrain v3.0 work, tailored for AIJ's audience and requirements. The scientific content remains identical to the root; only presentation elements are adjusted for venue alignment.

## Derivation Rules

- **Source**: All content derived from root `Journal Submission Package/` files
- **Modifications**: Only venue-specific tailoring (introduction framing, cover letter)
- **No Changes**: Core results, figures, methods, or conclusions are never altered
- **Sync**: If root files update, regenerate this projection

## File Mapping

### Manuscript
- `manuscript/spiralbrain_aij.tex` → Derived from `spiralbrain_journal_submission.tex`
  - Minor adjustments: Introduction framing for architecture emphasis
  - Related work: Emphasize symbolic systems, cognitive architectures

### Figures
- `figures/` → Copied verbatim from root `figures/`
  - four_lobe_architecture.pdf/png
  - spiral_coherence_manifold.pdf/png
  - neurodivergent_validation.pdf/png

### Cover Letter
- `cover_letter/cover_letter_aij.tex` → AIJ-specific cover letter
  - Highlights architecture contributions
  - Addresses AIJ editorial priorities

### Metadata
- `metadata/keywords.txt` → AIJ-optimized keywords
- `metadata/highlights.txt` → Key findings summary (Elsevier format)
- `metadata/author_declarations.txt` → Declarations and conflicts

## Submission Instructions

1. Use `manuscript/spiralbrain_aij.tex` as primary submission file
2. Include all figures from `figures/`
3. Attach cover letter from `cover_letter/`
4. Provide metadata as required by AIJ

## Maintenance

This folder should be regenerated if root files change. Do not edit core content here—changes belong in the canonical root.
