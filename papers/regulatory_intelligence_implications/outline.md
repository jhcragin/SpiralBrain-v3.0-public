# Regulatory Intelligence as a Foundational Layer for Safe Cognitive Systems

## 1. Introduction
- The brittleness problem in modern AI
- Limits of post-hoc alignment and filtering

## 2. Regulatory Intelligence
- Definition
- Distinction from learning and optimization
- Self-monitoring without selfhood

## 3. Internal Coherence as a Safety Primitive
- Hazard, drift, stability
- Why nonsense is structurally costly
- Refusal and throttling as safety features

## 4. Architectural Framing
- RI as a foundational layer
- The "guide rails" metaphor
- The "medulla oblongata" analogy (explicitly metaphorical)

## 5. Ethical Implications (Non-Speculative)
- Safety without agency
- Alignment without obedience
- No moral status claims

## 6. Limitations and Risks
- Adversarial stress shaping
- Over-conservatism
- Scalability concerns

## 7. Future Research Directions
- RI + learning hybrids
- Hierarchical regulation
- Evaluation beyond benchmarks

## 8. Conclusion
