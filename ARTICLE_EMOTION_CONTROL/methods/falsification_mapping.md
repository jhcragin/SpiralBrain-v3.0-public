# Falsification Mapping

This document maps falsification conditions to specific artifacts used in testing the hypothesis.

| Falsification Type | Condition | Relevant Artifacts |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Partial | Symbolic coherence demonstrates autonomous recovery or sustained stability under defined stress conditions without regulatory intervention in a subset of tested cases | - `../data/emotional_logs/session_2025-12-24_13-52-35.yaml` (intervention logs showing pre/post stability changes)<br>- `../data/full_brain_stress/full_brain_stress_report.md` (reports on recovery efficiency) |
| Full | Symbolic processes consistently maintain stability and recover without affective regulation across all tested systems and stress scenarios | - `../data/full_brain_stress/full_brain_stress_report.md` (comprehensive stress test results)<br>- All benchmark suites referenced in provenance |

Falsification is evaluated through controlled experiments where symbolic coherence is quantified using recursive logical stability metrics, stress is induced via coupling and hazard variations, and regulatory interventions determine recovery pathways.
