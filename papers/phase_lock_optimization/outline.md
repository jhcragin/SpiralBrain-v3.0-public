# Phase Lock Optimization in Regulatory Cognitive Architectures

## 1. Introduction
- Problem: instability in multi-pathway cognitive systems
- Why optimization-centric models fail under stress
- Regulatory framing

## 2. Background
- Differentiation vs coherence trade-off
- Phase relationships in coupled systems
- Why phase matters in cognition-like architectures

## 3. Regulatory Architecture Overview
- Brief description of SpiralBrain-style multi-pathway systems
- Clean-slate, non-learning constraint (important)

## 4. Phase Lock Formalism
- Definition of phase separation
- Measurement methodology
- Performance and stability metrics

## 5. Empirical Discovery of Optimal Phase Lock
- Experimental setup
- Identification of ~74° optimum
- Robustness across runs

## 6. Control-Theoretic Interpretation
- Why low angles collapse differentiation
- Why high angles collapse integration
- Phase lock as a saddle point, not a constant

## 7. Limitations
- Architecture specificity
- Dimensionality constraints
- No claim of biological equivalence

## 8. Implications
- Design of stable cognitive systems
- Relevance to AI safety and interpretability

## 9. Conclusion
