# SpiralBrain v3.0 - Canonical Configuration

This repository corresponds to the canonical SpiralBrain-v3.0 configuration described in the paper "Elastic Cognition and the Spiral Architecture: Empirical Discoveries from a Neurodivergent Cognitive Model".

## Overview

SpiralBrain v3.0 implements a neurodivergent-inspired cognitive architecture featuring elastic cognition through spiral coherence manifolds. This public repository provides documentation and resources for the canonical configuration validated in the reported experiments.

## Scope

This public repository contains:
- High-level architectural documentation
- Theoretical framework descriptions
- Reproducibility guidelines
- Configuration summaries for the canonical setup

**Note**: Auxiliary and exploratory components not exercised in the reported experiments are intentionally excluded to maintain focus on the scientifically validated configuration. The full implementation is available under research license.

## Key Features

- Multi-pathway cognitive processing
- Spiral coherence manifold for elastic cognition
- Central Coordination Nexus (CCN)
- Regulatory learning systems
- Empirical validation across a comprehensive cognitive benchmark suite

## Reproducibility

For complete reproducibility instructions, see the [Journal Submission Package](https://github.com/jhcragin/SpiralBrain-v3.0-public/tree/main/publication_package) which includes:
*Results in this repository correspond directly to figures and analyses reported in the manuscript.*

*The `scripts/` directory contains the figure-generation and analysis scripts used to produce the results reported in the manuscript. The `results/` directory contains the corresponding benchmark outputs and summaries.*

- Detailed methodology
- Benchmark specifications
- Validation protocols
