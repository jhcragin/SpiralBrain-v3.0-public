## 🚨 Risk Management

### What If You Can't Raise Full Budget?

**Fallback Plan 1: Bare Minimum Pro Se ($2K)**
- DIY everything
- Basic drawings only
- File electronically
- Risk: Weaker claims, more likely to need amendments

**Fallback Plan 2: Claims-Only Attorney ($4K-$5K)**
- You write specification (60-80 hours)
- Attorney writes claims only (critical part)
- Better than pure DIY, cheaper than full service
- Good compromise option

**Fallback Plan 3: Provisional Extension (Last Resort)**
- File second provisional ($130)
- Buys another 12 months
- ⚠️ Only do if absolutely necessary
- Delays patent grant by a year

### What If You Miss the Deadline?

**If missed by < 2 months:**
- Petition for revival ($2,000+ penalty)
- Must show it was unintentional
- Not guaranteed

**If missed by > 2 months:**
- ❌ Priority date lost
- Must file as new application
- ⚠️ Competitors can file meanwhile
- **DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN**
