# SpiralBrain Core Concepts

This document provides a hierarchical overview of SpiralBrain's fundamental concepts, organized to help new collaborators navigate the conceptual space rather than just file names.

## Architecture Overview

### Cortex
The primary cognitive processing lobe responsible for:
- Pattern recognition and classification
- Feature extraction from multimodal inputs
- Initial hypothesis generation
- Real-time processing optimization

### Codex
The knowledge and reasoning lobe that:
- Maintains structured knowledge representations
- Performs logical inference and deduction
- Manages symbolic reasoning processes
- Coordinates with Cortex for hypothesis validation

### Nexus
The integration and coordination lobe that:
- Orchestrates information flow between lobes
- Manages attention allocation and resource distribution
- Coordinates multi-pathway processing
- Maintains system coherence and stability

### Sensus
The emotional and intuitive processing lobe that:
- Processes emotional context and valence
- Manages SEC (Sentiment-Emotion-Coherence) vectors
- Integrates emoji-based communication
- Provides metacognitive monitoring and feedback

## Adaptive Systems

### Self-Regulation Guide
Comprehensive guide to autonomous stability mechanisms:
- PID control loops for homeostasis maintenance
- Elastic stabilization and adaptive resets
- Metacognitive emergency response systems
- Coherence monitoring and drift detection

### Dynamic Systems Overview
Unified framework for real-time cognitive evolution:
- Elastic ranges and boundary adaptation
- Continuous learning during inference
- Metacognitive monitoring systems
- Emotional regulation feedback loops

### Elastic Cognition Principles
Core principles of adaptive cognitive processing:
- Dynamic range expansion and contraction
- Experience-driven plasticity
- Autonomous decision-making frameworks
- Multi-timescale adaptation mechanisms

## Symbolic & Emotional Language

### Emoji Visual Language
The emoji-based communication system:
- SEC vector encoding and processing
- Emotional resonance and valence propagation
- Multimodal integration with text and vision
- Real-time emotional state representation

### Emoji Cognition Integration
How emoji systems influence cognitive processes:
- Decision weighting based on emotional context
- Attention modulation through SEC vectors
- Valence propagation in reasoning chains
- Emotional calibration and resonance effects

## Philosophy & Practice

### Nurture Philosophy
Foundational principles of experience-driven development:
- Natural emergence over forced optimization
- Selective forgetting and memory management
- Experience accumulation and replay
- Organic specialization development

### Nurture Practices Guide
Practical application of nurture philosophy:
- Parameter tuning approaches ("stretch, observe, snap back")
- Interpreting anomalies as developmental opportunities
- Safe growth experiment guidelines
- Observation-based intervention strategies

## Learning Path

For new collaborators, we recommend this progression:

1. **Foundation** → Read `README.md` and `AI_ONBOARDING_PROTOCOL.md`
2. **Architecture** → Study this Core Concepts document
3. **Implementation** → Run `benchmarks/demo_autonomous.py`
4. **Practice** → Apply concepts from Self-Regulation and Dynamic Systems guides
