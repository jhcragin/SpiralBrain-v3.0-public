# Data Provenance

This document details the origin and subsetting of data used in the paper "Emotion as a Control Signal for Symbolic Stability in Neurosymbolic Systems".

## emotional_intervention_subset.yaml
- **Source**: `SpiralBrain-v3.0/emotional_logs/session_2025-12-24_13-52-35.yaml`
- **Subset**: Full file copied as representative sample of intervention data
- **Purpose**: Provides pre/post coherence and SEC vector changes for Figure 1
- **Why included**: Demonstrates regulatory interventions affecting symbolic stability

## stress_recovery_summary.md
- **Source**: `SpiralBrain-v3.0/results/full_brain_stress/full_brain_stress_report.md`
- **Subset**: Full file copied
- **Purpose**: Documents recovery metrics and intervention effectiveness for Figure 2
- **Why included**: Shows differential recovery with vs. without regulation

## full_brain_stress/ folder
- **Source**: `SpiralBrain-v3.0/results/full_brain_stress/`
- **Subset**: Full folder copied
- **Purpose**: Additional stress test data for reproducibility
- **Why included**: Supports falsification analysis in methods

All data is subsetted to avoid duplication with prior publications and focuses only on regulatory effects on symbolic coherence.
