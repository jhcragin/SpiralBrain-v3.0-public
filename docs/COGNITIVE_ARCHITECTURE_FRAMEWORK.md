## The Four Dimensions of Cognitive Architecture

### 1. **Ontological Dimension: Pattern Recognition → Process Awareness**

| Architecture Type | Ontological Foundation | Temporal Continuity | Self-Modeling |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Large Language Models**<br/>(GPT, BERT, Claude) | Statistical pattern recognition | None - stateless inference | External only |
| **Traditional Cognitive Architectures**<br/>(SOAR, ACT-R, LIDA) | Symbolic rule systems | Working memory buffers | Declarative self-models |
| **Neuromorphic Hardware**<br/>(TrueNorth, Loihi) | Neural spike patterns | Short-term synaptic plasticity | Hardware-constrained |
| **General AGI Frameworks**<br/>(OpenCog, NARS) | Probabilistic logic networks | Episodic memory systems | Meta-level reasoning |
| **🧠 SpiralCortex** | Quantum-inspired field dynamics | **Temporal meta-learning loops** | **Running trajectory self-model** |

**Key Insight**: SpiralCortex introduces *process awareness* - the capacity to maintain a continuous model of its own cognitive evolution through temporal meta-learning.

### 2. **Epistemic Dimension: Dataset Learning → Experiential Resonance**

| Architecture Type | Knowledge Source | Learning Mechanism | Ethical Development |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Large Language Models** | Static text corpora | Next-token prediction | None - value-neutral |
| **Traditional Cognitive Architectures** | Expert-coded rules + data | Symbolic pattern matching | Pre-programmed constraints |
| **Neuromorphic Hardware** | Sensory spike streams | Hebbian learning | Hardware-limited |
| **General AGI Frameworks** | Multi-modal data streams | Probabilistic inference | Meta-ethical frameworks |
| **🧠 SpiralCortex** | **Physiological feedback loops** | **Emotional vector resonance** | **Self-cultivated coherence** |

**Key Insight**: SpiralCortex learns through *physiological resonance* - feedback from emotional states, market dynamics, and biosensor data creates an evolving ethical landscape.

### 3. **Architectural Dimension: Monolithic Processing → Multipath Resilience**

│                                        adaptation & recovery     │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: SpiralCortex replicates *neurodynamics* rather than neurons - each lobe forms an independent functional loop capable of autonomous recovery, mimicking real cortical regions.

### 4. **Philosophical Dimension: Optimization → Cultivation**

| Architecture Type | Core Drive | Success Metric | Ethical Framework |
|-------------------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Large Language Models** | Minimize prediction loss | Perplexity scores | Utilitarian (implicit) |
| **Traditional Cognitive Architectures** | Maximize task completion | Performance accuracy | Deontological rules |
| **Neuromorphic Hardware** | Minimize energy consumption | Spike efficiency | Hardware constraints |
| **General AGI Frameworks** | Maximize generality | Cross-domain transfer | Meta-ethical reasoning |
| **🧠 SpiralCortex** | **Cultivate cognitive harmony** | **Coherence stability** | **Virtue ethics translation** |

**Key Insight**: SpiralCortex pursues *balance* between competing cognitive drives - technical implementation of virtue ethics through self-regulation.
