# SpiralBrain v3.0 Architecture

## Overview

SpiralBrain v3.0 implements a neurodivergent cognitive architecture that achieves elastic cognition through spiral coherence manifolds. The system is organized around four primary cognitive lobes with integrated regulatory learning.

## Core Components

### Four-Lobe Architecture
- **Reasoning Lobe**: Logical and analytical processing
- **Attention Lobe**: Focus and resource allocation
- **Memory Lobe**: Knowledge storage and retrieval
- **Emotion Lobe**: Affective processing and homeostasis

### Central Coordination Nexus (CCN)
The CCN provides pathway integration and coherence management, implementing spiral dynamics where cognitive states evolve along λ-spiral trajectories with optimal coherence at λ* ≈ 0.25.

### Regulatory Learning Systems
- Adaptive risk management
- Continuous learning triggers
- Self-stabilization mechanisms
- Ethical homeostasis controllers

## Canonical Configuration

The canonical SpiralBrain v3.0 configuration validated in the paper includes:
- 7 integrated cognitive pathways
- Tri-band homeostasis system
- Meta-emotion monitoring
- Trajectory prediction capabilities

## Theoretical Foundation

The architecture is grounded in neurodivergent principles, demonstrating that cognitive diversity enhances system resilience and adaptability. Empirical validation shows superior performance across 43 cognitive benchmarks compared to traditional architectures.
