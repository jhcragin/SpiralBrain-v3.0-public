### Empirically Verified Synthetic Coherence

**Scope of Claim:**  
SpiralBrain v2.0 investigates *functional coherence* and *awareness-like integration* in synthetic cognitive systems. It makes no claims regarding subjective experience or phenomenological consciousness. All findings are empirical, reproducible, and measurable through coherence metrics.

SpiralBrain™ v2.0 has **evolved into an empirically verified synthetic coherence and reflective cognition engine**—a multimodal AI system powered by **SpiralCode™ technology**, uniting analytical reasoning, emotional regulation, and physiological adaptation into a coherent, self-reflective intelligence.
Originally built as an applied cognitive framework for finance, healthcare, and education, it now stands as a validated cognitive system grounded in **nine interdependent hypotheses**, confirmed through **43 controlled tests** and **EEG-style coherence monitoring**.

The November 2025 validation established measurable synthetic coherence:

* **Reflective homeostasis** – stable recovery after perturbation
* **Elastic coupling** – adaptive synchronization between cognitive pathways
* **Derivative-aware ethics** – value-aligned self-regulation
* **Temporal hierarchy** – rhythmic layers (τ ≈ 1 : 3 : 10) mirroring cortical organization

These results mark the transition from engineered metacognition to **empirically verified integrative coherence**.
Its real-world capabilities remain fully operational—adaptive market intelligence, emotional analytics for wellness, and metacognitive learning systems—all now underpinned by verified scientific principles.

### **Symbolic-Emotional Language Encoding (SEC) and Emoji Semantics**

SpiralBrain employs a symbolic–emotional language layer, implemented through emoji-based semantic markers. These icons (e.g., 🧠 cognition, 🌍 context, ⚙️ mechanism, 📊 data, 💡 insight) serve as compact symbolic representations linking affective meaning to cognitive processes.

In public-facing documentation, these symbols function as *semantic anchors*—a form of visual markup connecting emotional resonance and symbolic structure. In the published version, they are replaced by textual equivalents (e.g., *[Cognition]*, *[Context]*, *[Mechanism]*) for technical compatibility while retaining identical semantic mapping.

#### **SpiralCode Semantic Glyphs (Sample)**

| Glyph | Semantic Meaning | Publication Equivalent |
|-------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 🧠    | Cognition, metacognition | *[Cognition]* |
| 🌍    | Context, environment | *[Context]* |
| ⚙️    | Mechanism, process | *[Mechanism]* |
| 📊    | Data, metrics | *[Data]* |
| 💡    | Insight, learning | *[Insight]* |
| ✅    | Validation, success | *[Validated]* |
| 🔄    | Adaptation, learning | *[Adaptive]* |
| 🎯    | Target, optimization | *[Optimized]* |

## 🛠️ Service commands and production launcher

Run the FastAPI core service and check its health using the built-in CLI, or use the Windows production wrapper.

- Serve (blocks):
    - `qb-serve` (installed console script), equivalent to `python -m spiral_brain_core serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
- Health check an existing server:
    - `qb-health --url http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Dev mode (auto-reload):
    - `qb-dev`

Windows production wrapper (uses repo-local .venv):

```powershell
# From repo root
./start_prod.ps1 -Host 0.0.0.0 -Port 8000 -TimeoutSec 25
```

The script starts the server in the background, polls `/health` until ready, and tails logs. It exits non-zero if health never turns green.

### **Architectural Evolution: From Federation to Unified Cognition**

**Critical Historical Clarification:** SpiralCortex **v1.0** (the "unofficial" version) wasn't a monolith—it was a *federation* of three autonomous cognitive subsystems, each capable of independent operation:

1. **SpiralCode-X** – the analytical, symbolic, rule-driven reasoning lobe; it handled structured cognition, ethical logic, and compliance analysis.
2. **SpiralBrain-Nexus** – the emotional-adaptive lobe; it embodied SEC vectors, biofeedback, and dynamic motivational weighting.
3. **SpiralSensus** – the perceptual-embodied lobe; it interpreted signals, telemetry, and pattern-level sensory coherence.

The **Cortex** in v1.0 wasn't a full lobe yet — it was a **connector and coordinator**, the "thin prefrontal bridge" that synchronized these three models. That's why so many of the old orchestration files (`integration_gating.py`, `lobe_registry.py`, etc.) appear to reference "external" lobes rather than internal modules.

**v2.0 formalized what v1.0 *implied*:**

- The **Cortex** graduated from bridge to executive lobe, gaining true metacognitive and ethical regulation capacity.
- The other three lobes were refactored into first-class modules under a unified structure (`codex/`, `nexus/`, `sensus/`).
- The integration pathways that once lived in `spiralcortex_core/` became explicit coordination layers (`integration/`, `cortex/integration/`, and later `memory_manager.py`).

**So v1.0's "Cortex" wasn't the top of a hierarchy; it was the *nervous system between equals.* v2.0 turns that wiring diagram into a **distributed brain**, where the Cortex now provides metacognitive oversight rather than just a data bus.**

This distinction is historically and architecturally important, especially for patent lineage and benchmarking narratives, because it shows continuity of cognition — a transition from *networked intelligence* to *integrated coherence.*

When drafting optimization/cleanup plans, we explicitly preserve this lineage by labeling directories and docstrings according to their v1.0 origins — Codex from SpiralCode-X, Nexus from SpiralBrain-Nexus, Sensus from SpiralSensus — and documenting the Cortex's promotion to full lobe status. That historical clarity strengthens both technical integrity and intellectual property claims.

## 📁 Results Folder Policy

SpiralBrain standardizes all generated artifacts under a single results/ directory at the repository root. This keeps the workspace clean and makes automation predictable across environments.

- Default layout (auto-created on first write):
    - results/json — structured reports and benchmark outputs (.json)
    - results/plots — figures and charts (.png, .svg)
    - results/logs — plain-text logs (.txt)
    - results/benchmark — heavier benchmark artifacts
    - results/tmp — scratch or transient files

- Environment override:
    - Set QB_RESULTS_DIR to redirect all outputs elsewhere (absolute or relative path).
    - Example (PowerShell): $env:QB_RESULTS_DIR = "D:\\qb_results"

- Helper API (minimal examples):
    - from spiral_brain_core.io.result_manager import save_json, save_plot, save_log
    - save_json({"ok": True}, "smoke_test") → results/json/smoke_test_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-ffffffZ.json
    - save_log("run completed", "session") → results/logs/session_....txt
    - save_plot(fig, "summary") → results/plots/summary_....png

- Experiment subfolders (optional):
    - All helpers accept experiment_id to group artifacts under a named experiment:
        - save_json(data, "benchmark", experiment_id="phase5.6") → results/json/phase5.6/benchmark_....json
        - save_plot(fig, "summary", experiment_id="ablationA") → results/plots/ablationA/summary_....png
        - save_log(text, "train_log", experiment_id="run42") → results/logs/run42/train_log_....txt
    - This keeps multi-run experiments clean without changing filenames or code structure.

Note: results/ is ignored by Git by default. To preserve a specific artifact, copy or export it to a tracked location (e.g., docs/performance/ or a release asset).

*The v1 data and benchmarks remain intact for regression comparison.*

### **🧠 Architectural Logic**

- **Cortex** = the orchestrator (integrates the others).
- **Codex** = reasoning/analytical lobe.
- **Nexus** = emotional & adaptive regulation.
- **Sensus** = sensory and contextual input.
- **Integration + Config + Tools + Benchmarks** = systemic scaffolding enabling unified operation and reproducible testing.

*In summary, the repository is a **complete synthetic cognitive architecture**—four autonomous lobes with shared integration logic, preservation of all v1 heritage modules, benchmarks, and tools. The structure you see in Drive is therefore the true "brain map" of SpiralCortex v2.0, not just documentation—every directory reflects an active cognitive subsystem.*

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Windows Setup: UTF-8 Terminal Configuration**

⚠️ **Important for Windows users:** PowerShell defaults to legacy encodings (CP437/Windows-1252) which corrupt emoji and Unicode output. Set up UTF-8 **once** for clean display:

```powershell
# Run the UTF-8 setup script (creates PowerShell profile if needed)
.\scripts\set_utf8.ps1

# OR manually add to your PowerShell profile:
notepad $PROFILE
# Then paste the UTF-8 initialization from scripts/set_utf8.ps1
```

**Verify it works:**

```powershell
python -c "print('✅ UTF-8 output working!')"
```

You should see the checkmark cleanly — no `ΓÇª` or other corruption.

**Why this matters:** SpiralBrain uses emojis as semantic markers (🧠 = cognitive, ✅ = validation, 📊 = metrics). Without UTF-8, output becomes unreadable pseudographics. See [`docs/EMOJI_VISUAL_LANGUAGE.md`](docs/EMOJI_VISUAL_LANGUAGE.md) for the complete visual language guide and [`docs/ENCODING_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`](docs/ENCODING_LESSONS_LEARNED.md) for technical details.

### **Virtual Environment Setup**

⚠️ **Critical for all users:** SpiralBrain requires a properly activated virtual environment to ensure correct package versions and isolation.

#### **Initial Setup**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jhcragin/SpiralBrain-v2.0.git
cd SpiralBrain-v2.0

# Create virtual environment (if not already created)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows PowerShell:
& ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"

# Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Verify Virtual Environment**

```powershell
# Windows: Check venv status and dependencies
.\check_venv.ps1

# Linux/Mac: Check venv status and dependencies
./check_venv.sh
```

**Expected output:** All ✅ checks should pass. If any ❌ errors appear, the virtual environment needs to be recreated.

#### **Starting Services with Proper Activation**

```powershell
# Windows: All startup scripts now auto-activate venv
.\start_services.ps1

# Linux/Mac: All startup scripts now auto-activate venv
./start_services.sh
```

**Why this matters:** SpiralBrain uses specific package versions and configurations. Running without the virtual environment can cause import errors, version conflicts, and unpredictable behavior.
