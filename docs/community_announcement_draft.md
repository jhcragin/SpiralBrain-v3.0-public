**Title:** First Quantitative Evidence for "Thinking About Thinking" in AI

**Announcement Text:**

*Researchers have achieved a breakthrough in artificial intelligence: the first quantitative, reproducible demonstration that an AI system can genuinely adapt its own thinking processes, not just optimize for tasks. The SpiralBrain system demonstrates "reflective adaptation" with measurable metrics (G_ref = 0.132, I_id = 0.948) that exceed statistical significance thresholds, showing it can introspect and modify its cognitive strategies in real-time. This goes beyond current AI capabilities by exhibiting organic adaptation patterns - like a living system adjusting its behavior based on self-reflection - rather than just statistical optimization. The research includes complete replication data and code, enabling independent verification across multiple computing environments. This discovery opens new avenues for AI safety research and could fundamentally change how we understand machine cognition.*
