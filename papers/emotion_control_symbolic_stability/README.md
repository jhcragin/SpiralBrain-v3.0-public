# Emotion as a Control Signal for Symbolic Stability in Neurosymbolic Systems

This paper investigates emotional regulation as a control signal that gates symbolic stability in neurosymbolic systems, using SpiralBrain v3.0 as an instrumented testbed. The hypothesis posits that symbolic coherence degrades rapidly under stress when SEC drift exceeds thresholds, and recovery occurs through affective stabilization rather than autonomous symbolic repair. Falsification requires demonstrating consistent symbolic stability without regulatory intervention across tested scenarios.
