## 🛡️ How Protected Are You?

### Against Competitors Patenting Your Technology
**Protection:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (100%)  
Your provisional patent establishes priority. Nobody can patent the same methods unless you abandon your application.

### Against Brand Name Copying
**Protection:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (80%)  
Common law trademark gives you strong regional protection. Registered trademark would give nationwide presumption but isn't required.

### Against Code Copying
**Protection:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (100%)  
Automatic copyright protection. Anyone copying your code without license is liable.

### Against Someone Implementing Your Methods
**Protection:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (100% after patent grants)  
Once non-provisional is filed and granted, anyone implementing your patented methods without license is infringing.
